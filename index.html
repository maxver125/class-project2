                <p class="rock-artical">In early December 2007, a massive landslide deposited approximately half a million cubic metres of rock and sediment into Chehalis Lake. The force of the material entering the lake generated a wave thatâ€™s estimated to be 50 feet in height in some places. The wave scoured much of the shoreline and inundated three Ministry of Tourism, Sport and the Arts campgrounds: Chehalis South, Skwellepil and Chehalis North.

The combination of landslide and wave also created a large woody debris mat and is currently floating loose on the lake.

The Forest Service recognizes that this is a unique event in British Columbia. The landslide site is still very unstable and should not be viewed as a sightseeing opportunity until such time as the area is deemed safe by qualified geoscientists.

In partnership with the Chehalis First Nations Band; Provincial Emergency Preparedness; and the Ministry of Environment, the Forest Service is working to reduce the flooding hazard created by the floating debris mat. To this end, a staging area is being established at the Chehalis Lake south campground to assist crews and equipment to secure the floating debris with log booms, with the intent to eventually dewater the debris and dispose of it.

The Chehalis and Mystery Creek Forest Service Roads will be closed until further notice. In the interest of public and environmental safety, access is restricted to authorized personnel only.</p>
